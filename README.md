Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using a deep learning model. The goal is to help banks identify customers likely to leave and take proactive steps to retain them.

Key Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset.
Deep Learning Model: Built and trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras for accurate churn prediction.
Model Deployment: Saved the trained model using pickle and deployed it via a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

How to Use
Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
Run the Streamlit app to input customer details and predict churn probability.
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment, providing valuable insights into customer retention.
